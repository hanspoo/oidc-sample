# oidc react keycloak starter

React-oidc-context starter with keycloak, built with a simple React project with Vite.

Weâ€™ve used the bare minimum libraries, adding only some presentational support with Tailwind, Daisyui, and Heroicons.
The idea is to make it as agnostic as possible so it can serve as a starting point for different frameworks.
It provides a good user experience for detecting errors in the Keycloak server and is quite responsive. The mobile version features a disappearing left bar with a hamburger menu and an avatar icon for the user and its session.

This is a sample starter for a react project:

- react
- keycloak
- react-oidc-context
- tailwind & daisyui
- Hamburger menu
- Sidebar when logged in

## Quick start

Video help:
`[https://youtu.be/NVn1Ewt2t7M](https://youtu.be/s5olUXBTy-k)`

```
git clone https://github.com/hanspoo/oidc-sample
cd oidc-sample/
npm install
```

Copy .env.sample to .env

```
cp .env.sample .env
```

In one terminal start the keycloak server with the quicktart realm configured:

```
cd docker-dev
docker compose up
```

You can manage the keycloak instance at `http://localhost:8080` with user and pass "admin".

This will keep the compose running in the terminal, if you like to send it
to the background use the -d argument `docker compose up -d`.

Start react app, in other terminal execute:

```
npm run dev
```

Go to the browser at the address shown in the command output, usually: `http://localhost:5173/`
